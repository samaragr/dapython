    #1 for Deposit

#Once the user selects an option and an account, prompt them to enter their chosen amount if option 1 was selected.
    #If option 2 was selected show the user’s balance.
        #Furthermore, you must ensure that the user has enough money. If not start back at step 1.

#At the end of the transaction summarize users account information and then prompt them with starting at step 1 again.

#Keep doing step 1 to 5 until the user types ‘q’.

#Once they enter ‘q’,
    #Print out all accounts and balances.
    #Write the result to your file OpeningAccountsData.txt(overriding previous data).
    #When you rerun the project, the new balances should be displayed.

#they should receive the reply “Wrong Input” plus an appropriate message,
#additionally you must return the user back to step 1 (Prompting the user for their account number).
